# Horiseon-challenge

* As a developer I want to refactor a webpage so that it meets accessibility standards

* It is done when I view the source code I find samantic HTML elements

* It is done when I view the structure of the HTML elements find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* It is done when I view the image elements I find accessible alt attributes

* It is done when I view the heading attributes they fall in sequential order

* It is done when I view the title element I find a concise, descriptive title
